# Ironwood Restorations Open Source Projects & Builds

Welcome to the Ironwood Restorations Public Repository, a home for everything I create and share on my YouTube channel from hands-on automotive conversions to custom-built software tools.

Here you’ll find open-source resources for:
- Automotive Modifications: hybrid conversions, lighting systems, power management, and control modules  
- Software Tools & Scripts: utilities like the *Custom DTC Builder*, data simulators, and diagnostic tools  
- 3D Models & PCB Designs: custom brackets, modules, enclosures, and circuit boards  
- Wiring Diagrams & Pinouts: detailed schematics for integration and troubleshooting  
- General DIY Projects: creative builds, prototyping experiments, and maker tools  

Everything here is open source: made for learning, modifying, and building upon.

## Project Highlights

| Project | Description | Type |
|----------|--------------|------|
| Custom DTC Builder | Design and print tables of user-defined Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) to PDF. Useful for custom ECUs, data simulators, and testing setups. | Software Tool |
| Hybrid Conversion Platform | Documentation and files for converting a conventional vehicle into a hybrid setup includes wiring diagrams, firmware logic, and component integration. | Automotive / Hardware |
| Smart Toolbox Lighting | Adds in-drawer lighting and power management to shop toolboxes using sensors and microcontrollers. | DIY / Electronics |
| CAN Bus Utility Scripts | Python and Arduino-based tools for sending, sniffing, and analyzing CAN messages. | Code / Automotive |

*(More projects are added and updated as new videos go live, sometimes you can get a sneak peek at upcoming project topics here a day or two early!)*
